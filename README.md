# som--tg-station
WIP/Test output of the Somnium transdecompiler on tgstation.

## Progress
*Note: A successful decompile does not necessarily imply that the function will work or is *correctly* decompiled!*
Nov 1: 102 / 234 global functions decompiled.

## License
[Licenses of tgstation.](https://github.com/somnium13/-tg-station#license) I'm not really sure how these apply to this project.
