# som--tg-station
WIP/Test output of the Somnium transdecompiler on tgstation.

## Progress
*Note: A successful decompile does not necessarily imply that the function was -correctly- decompiled!*

- Nov 1: 102 / 234 global functions decompiled.
- Later: 138 / 253
- Nov 2: 236 / 363

**Current:** 65% of globals decompiled!
