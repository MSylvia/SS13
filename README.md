# som--tg-station
WIP/Test output of the Somnium transdecompiler on tgstation.

## Progress
*Note: A successful decompile does not necessarily indicate that the function was -correctly- decompiled!*

*Note: Due to the discovery algorithem, more global functions will be found as more code is decompiled!*

- Nov 1: 102 / 234 global functions decompiled.
- Nov 2: 242 / 366
- Nov 3: 301 / 373
- Nov 4: 374 / 402

**Current:** 93% of globals decompiled!
