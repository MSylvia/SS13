# somnium-ss13
TG Branch of SS13, now in C#!

This is the entirety of tgstation, translated from DM to C#. You're probably wondering why I'd dedicate such a significant chunk of my time to such an idiotic goal. See [here](A_ROBUST_PROPOSAL.md) for my rationale.

- If you want to become part of my crack team of non-skids, hit me up at bigboysauceboss@aol.com
- Getting libraries implemented is the most important task at hand. See the [engine](https://github.com/somnium13/somnium-engine) repo.
- After that we need to build the engine and the client. The plan is to make a webclient that actually works.
- We need a new map format. Again, don't jump the gun on this. A lot of consideration needs to go into it.
- Anyone know how DMIs work? Should we replace them with our own format or just roll with them?
- If you have a problem with the generated code, please submit an issue here!
- I will not, under any circumstances, release the transcompiler.
- I will transcompile other codebases on request. Eventually.

## Progress

- Oct 8: Project started!
- Nov 1: Started generating coherant code.
- Nov 15: 100% of functions decompiled.
- Jan 5: **It compiles.**
- Jan 6: Globals initialize without throwing exceptions.
- Current: Assembling the Meme Team.
