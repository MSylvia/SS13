WIP/Test output of the Somnium transdecompiler on tgstation.

## Progress
*Note: A successful decompile does not necessarily indicate that the function was -correctly- decompiled!*

*Note: Due to the discovery algorithem, more global functions will be found as more code is decompiled!*

- Nov 1: 102 / 234 global functions decompiled.
- Nov 2: 242 / 366
- Nov 3: 301 / 373
- Nov 4: 374 / 402
- Nov 5: 412 / 412 **(100%)**
- Nov 6: No more gotos in global functions.
- Nov 7: Various Improvements
- Nov 8: Various Improvements
- Nov 9: Fixed oddball indexing.
- Nov 10: 8701 / 13382 total functions decompiled.
- Nov 11: 12892 / 13406
- Nov 12: 12953 / 13407
- Nov 13: 13148 / 13432
