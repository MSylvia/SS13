# som--tg-station
WIP/Test output of the Somnium transdecompiler on tgstation.

## Hello, World!
As this project starts generating usable code, there are a few points I'd like to make:
- If you want to become part of my crack team of non-skids, hit me up at bigboysauceboss@aol.com
- Please do not jump the gun and start editing the code. It is autogenerated, and still has many issues.
- When the code does work, please THINK before editing. It will take quite a lot of planning to refactor the code into a more modular and coherant form.
- If you have an issue with the generated code, please submit an issue!
- I will not, under any circumstances, release the code for the transcompiler.
- I will transcompile other codebases on request.

## Progress

- Oct 8: Project started!
- Nov 1: Started generating coherant code.
- Nov 15: LTG1 complete! 100% of functions decompiled.*
- Current:** Fixing issues with C# code generation. Going to try getting it compiling by the new year!
