# som--tg-station
WIP/Test output of the Somnium transdecompiler on tgstation.

Not sure if squirrel will stay the target language. It has issues. Lua has more. Not sure if modifying one of the two would be a good idea.

## Progress
*Note: A successful decompile does not necessarily indicate that the function was -correctly- decompiled!*
*Note: Due to the discovery algorithem, more global functions will be found as more code is decompiled!*

- Nov 1: 102 / 234 global functions decompiled.
- Later: 138 / 253
- Nov 2: 242 / 366

**Current:** 66% of globals decompiled!
