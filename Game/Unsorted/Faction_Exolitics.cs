They are so radically different to humans that their attempts of communication with other life forms is completely incomprehensible. Members of this alien race are capable of broadcasting subspace transmissions from their bodies. The religious leaders of the Tiger Cooperative claim to have the technology to decypher and interpret their messages, which have been confirmed as religious propaganda. Their motives are unknown but they are otherwise not considered much of a threat to anyone. They are virtually indestructable because of their nonphysical composition, and have the frighetning ability to make anything stop existing in a second.";
