They prefer old-fashion technology and a focus on aggressive but precise hostility against Nanotrasen and their corrupt Communistic methodology. They pose the most significant threat to Nanotrasen because of their possession of weapons of mass destruction, and their enormous military force. Their funding comes primarily from Cybersun Industries, provided they meet a destruction and sabatogue quota. Their operations can vary from covert to all-out. They recently stepped down as the leaders of the coalition, to be succeeded by Cybersun Industries. Because of their hate of Nanotrasen communism, they began provoking revolution amongst the employees using borrowed Cybersun mind-manipulation technology. They were founded when Waffle and Donk co splinter cells joined forces based on their similar interests and philosophies. Today, they act as a constant pacifier of Donk and Waffle co disputes, and full-time aggressor of Nanotrasen.";

You are completely free to accomplish your objectives any way you see fit.";
