It is unknown how the wizards are even able to communicate; some suggest a form of telepathic hive-mind. Not much is known about the wizards or their philosphies and motives. They appear to attack random civilian, corporate, planetary, orbital, pretty much any sort of organized facility they come across. Members of the Wizards Federation are considered amongst the most dangerous individuals in the known universe, and have been labeled threats to humanity by most governments. As such, they are enemies of both Nanotrasen and the Syndicate.";
