Their role in the syndicate coalition is unknown, but MI13 operatives generally tend be stealthy and avoid killing people and combating Nanotrasen forces. MI13 is not a real organization, it is instead an alias to a larger splinter-cell coalition in the Syndicate itself. Most operatives will know nothing of the actual MI13 organization itself, only motivated by a very large compensation.";
