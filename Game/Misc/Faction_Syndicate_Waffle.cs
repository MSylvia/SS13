Their waffles have been rumored to be dipped in the most exotic and addictive drug known to man. They were involved in a political scandal with Donk.co, and have since been in constant war with them. Because of their constant exploits of the galactic economy and stock market, they have been able to bribe their way into amassing a large arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. They target Nanotrasen because of their communistic threat, and their economic threat. Their leaders often have a twisted sense of humor, often misleading and intentionally putting their operatives into harm for laughs.A splinter-cell of Waffle.co merged with Donk.co and formed the Gorlex Marauders and have been a constant ally since. The Waffle.co has lost an overwhelming majority of its military to the Gorlex Marauders.";
