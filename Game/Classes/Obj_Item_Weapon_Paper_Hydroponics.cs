<BR>
I didn't trust the station folk so I left<BR>
a couple of weeks ago. But here's some<BR>
instructions on how to operate things here.<BR>
You can grow plants and each iteration they become<BR>
stronger, more potent and have better yield, if you<BR>
know which ones to pick. Use your botanist's analyzer<BR>
for that. You can turn harvested plants into seeds<BR>
at the seed extractor, and replant them for better stuff!<BR>
Sometimes if the weed level gets high in the tray<BR>
mutations into different mushroom or weed species have<BR>
been witnessed. On the rare occassion even weeds mutate!<BR>
<BR>
Either way, have fun!<BR>
<BR>
Best regards,<BR>
Billy Bob Johnson.<BR>
<BR>
PS.<BR>
Here's a few tips:<BR>
In nettles, potency = damage<BR>
In amanitas, potency = deadliness + side effect<BR>
In Liberty caps, potency = drug power + effect<BR>
In chilis, potency = heat<BR>
<B>Nutrients keep mushrooms alive!</B><BR>
<B>Water keeps weeds such as nettles alive!</B><BR>
<B>All other plants need both.</B>";
