		<h1>THE E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR</h1>
		The Enhanced Xenobiological Period Extraction (and) Restoration Instructor is a machine designed to discover the secrets behind every item in existence.
		With advanced technology, it can process 99.95% of items, and discover their uses and secrets.
		The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR is a Research apparatus that takes items, and through a process of elimination, it allows you to deduce new technological designs from them.
		Due to the volatile nature of the E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR, there is a slight chance for malfunction, potentially causing irreparable damage to you or your environment.
		However, upgrading the apparatus has proven to decrease the chances of undesirable, potentially life-threatening outcomes.
		Please note that the E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR uses a state-of-the-art random generator, which has a larger entropy than the observable universe,
		therefore it can generate wildly different results each day, therefore it is highly suggested to re-scan objects of interests frequently (e.g. each shift).

		<h2>BASIC PROCESS</h2>
		The usage of the E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR is quite simple:
		<ol>
			<li>Find an item with a technological background</li>
			<li>Insert the item into the E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR</li>
			<li>Cycle through each processing method of the device.</li>
			<li>Stand back, even in case of a successful experiment, as the machine might produce undesired behaviour.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>ADVANCED USAGE</h2>
		The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR has a variety of uses, beyond menial research work. The different results can be used to combat localised events, or even to get special items.

		The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR's OBLITERATE function has the added use of transferring the destroyed item's material into a linked lathe.

		The IRRADIATE function can be used to transform items into other items, resulting in potential upgrades (or downgrades).

		Users should remember to always wear appropriate protection when using the machine, because malfunction can occur at any moment!

		<h1>EVENTS</h1>
		<h2>GLOBAL (happens at any time):</h2>
			<ol>

			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR's onboard detection system has malfunctioned!</li>

			<li>IANIZATION - The machine's onboard corgi-filter has malfunctioned, causing it to produce a corgi from.. somewhere.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR melts the banana, ian-izing the air around it!</li>

			<li>RUNTIME ERROR - The machine's onboard C4T-P processor has encountered a critical error, causing it to produce a cat from.. somewhere.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR encounters a run-time error!</li>

			<li>B100DG0D.EXE - The machine has encountered an unknown subroutine, which has been injected into it's runtime. It upgrades the held item!
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR improves the banana, drawing the life essence of those nearby!</li>

			<li>POWERSINK - The machine's PSU has tripped the charging mechanism! It consumes massive amounts of power!
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR begins to smoke and hiss, shaking violently!</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>FAIL:</h2>
			This event is produced when the item mismatches the selected experiment.
			Produces a random message similar to: ""the Banana rumbles, and shakes, the experiment was a failure!""

		<h2>POKE:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>WILD ARMS - The machine's gryoscopic processors malfunction, causing it to lash out at nearby people with it's arms.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions and destroys the banana, lashing it's arms out at nearby people!</li>

			<li>MISTYPE - The machine's interface has been garbled, and it switches to OBLITERATE.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions!</li>

			<li>THROW - The machine's spatial recognition device has shifted several meters across the room, causing it to try and repostion the item there.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions, throwing the banana!</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>IRRADIATE:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>RADIATION LEAK - The machine's shield has failed, resulting in a toxic radiation leak.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions, melting the banana and leaking radiation!</li>

			<li>RADIATION DUMP - The machine's recycling and containment functions have failed, resulting in a dump of toxic waste around it
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions, spewing toxic waste!</li>

			<li>MUTATION - The machine's radio-isotope level meter has malfunctioned, causing it over-irradiate the item, making it transform.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions, transforming the banana!</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>GAS:</h2>
			<ol>
			<li>TOXIN LEAK - The machine's filtering and vent systems have failed, resulting in a cloud of toxic gas being expelled.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR destroys the banana, leaking dangerous gas!</li>

			<li>GAS LEAK - The machine's vent systems have failed, resulting in a cloud of harmless, but obscuring gas.
			Produces the message: The E.X.P.E.R.I-MENTOR malfunctions, spewing harmless gas!</li>

			<li>ELECTROMAGNETIC IONS - The machine's electrolytic scanners have failed, causing a dangerous Electromagnetic reaction.
