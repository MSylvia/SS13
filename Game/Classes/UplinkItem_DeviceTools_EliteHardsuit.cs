When the built in helmet is deployed your identity will be protected, even in death, as the suit cannot be removed by outside forces. Toggling the suit into combat mode will allow you all the mobility of a loose fitting uniform without sacrificing armoring. Additionally the suit is collapsible, small enough to fit within a backpack. Nanotrasen crewmembers are trained to report red space suit sightings; these suits in particular are known to drive employees into a panic.";
