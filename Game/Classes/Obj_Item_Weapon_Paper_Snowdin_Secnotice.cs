	 disciplined properly if found slacking. Food hording is heavily discouraged as all outposts will be sharing from the same shipment every 2-3 months. Hording of supplies
	 should be punished severely as to prevent future incidients. Mutiny and/or rioting should be reported to central and dealt with swiftly. You're here to secure and protect
	 Nanotrasen assets, not be a police officer. Do what you must, but make sure its not messy.";
