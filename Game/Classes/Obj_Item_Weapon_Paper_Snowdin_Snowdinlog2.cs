	Theres two mid-way stops on the eastern and western sides of the valley so movement inbetween bases isn't horrible. Not too big of a fan of relying on the northen base for
	equal supply distribution, though.<br><br><b>August 27h</b><br>First shipment arrived finally, about 4 days after the gateway shipped. Insulation on these buildings is awful, thank god for the spare heaters at least.<br><br>
	<b>September 20th</b><br>Another shipment arrival, standard shit. Our radios have been picking up a weird signal during the nights recently, we've sent the transcripts over to the northen
	base to be decyphered. Probably some drunk russians or something equally stupid.<br><br><b>November 24th</b><br>We've lost communications with the northern base after recieving the last
	shipment of supplies. The snow has really kicked up recently, shits almost like a constant blizzard right now. Maybe it'll drop down soon so we can get a word in.<br><br>
