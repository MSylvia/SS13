				<li><b>Mass spectrometry</b> - MS is the procedure used used to measure and quantify the components of matter. The most prized tool in the field of
					'Materials analysis'</li>
				<li><b>Radiometric dating</b> - MS applied using the right carrier reagents can be used to accurately determine the age of a sample.</li>
				<li><b>Dissonance ratio</b> - This is a pseudoarbitrary value indicating the overal presence of a particular element in a greater composite.
					It takes into account volume, density, molecular excitation and isotope spread.</li>

				<h1><a name=""Analysis"">Analysis progression</a></h1>
				Modern mass spectrometry requires constant attention from the diligant researcher in order to be successul. There are many different elements to juggle,
					and later chapters will delve into them. For the spectrometry assistant, the first thing you need to know is that the scanner wavelength is automatically
					calculated for you. Just tweak the settings and try to match it with the actual wavelength as closely as possible.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Seal"">Seal integrity</a></h1>
				In order to maintain sterile and environmentally static procedures, a special chamber is setup inside the spectrometer. It's protected by a proprietary vacuum seal
					produced by top tier industrial science. It will only last for a certain number of scans before failing outright, but it can be resealed through use of nanite paste.
					Unfortunately, it's susceptible to malforming under heat stress so exposing it to higher temperatures will cause it's operation life to drop significantly.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Heat"">Heat management</a></h1>
				The scanner relies on a gyro-rotational system that varies in speed and intensity. Over the course of an ordinary scan, the RPMs can change dramatically. Higher RPMs
					means greater heat generation, but is necessary for the ongoing continuation of the scan. To offset heat production, spectrometers have an inbuilt cooling system.
					Researchers can modify the flow rate of coolant to aid in dropping temperature as necessary, but are advised that frequent coolant replacements may be necessary
					depending on coolant purity. Water and substances such as cryoxadone are viable substitutes, but nowhere near as effective as pure coolant itself.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Radiation"">Ambient radiation</a></h1>
				Researchers are warned that while operational, mass spectrometers emit period bursts of radiation and are thus advised to wear protective gear. In the event of
					radiation spikes, there is also a special shield that can be lowered to block emissions. Lowering this, however, will have the effect of blocking the scanner
					so use it sparingly.<br>
