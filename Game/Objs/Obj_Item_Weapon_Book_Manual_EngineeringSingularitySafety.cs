				<h3>Singularity Safety in Special Circumstances</h3>

				<h4>Power outage</h4>

				A power problem has made the entire station lose power? Could be station-wide wiring problems or syndicate power sinks. In any case follow these steps:
				<p>
				<b>Step one:</b> <b><font color='red'>PANIC!</font></b><br>
				<b>Step two:</b> Get your ass over to engineering! <b>QUICKLY!!!</b><br>
				<b>Step three:</b> Make sure the SMES is still powering the emitters, if not, setup the generator in secure storage and disconnect the emitters from the SMES.<br>
				<b>Step four:</b> Next, head over to the APC and swipe it with your <b>ID card</b> - if it doesn't unlock, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step five:</b> Open the console and disengage the cover lock.<br>
				<b>Step six:</b> Pry open the APC with a <b>Crowbar.</b><br>
				<b>Step seven:</b> Take out the empty <b>power cell.</b><br>
				<b>Step eight:</b> Put in the new, <b>full power cell</b> - if you don't have one, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step nine:</b> Quickly put on a <b>Radiation suit.</b><br>
				<b>Step ten:</b> Check if the <b>singularity field generators</b> withstood the down-time - if they didn't, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step eleven:</b> Since disaster was averted you now have to ensure it doesn't repeat. If it was a powersink which caused it and if the engineering apc is wired to the same powernet, which the powersink is on, you have to remove the piece of wire which links the apc to the powernet. If it wasn't a powersink which caused it, then skip to step 14.<br>
				<b>Step twelve:</b> Grab your crowbar and pry away the tile closest to the APC.<br>
				<b>Step thirteen:</b> Use the wirecutters to cut the wire which is conecting the grid to the terminal. <br>
				<b>Step fourteen:</b> Go to the bar and tell the guys how you saved them all. Stop reading this guide here.<br>
				<b>Step fifteen:</b> <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!!</b><br>
				</p>

				<h4>Shields get damaged</h4>

				Step one: <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!! FORGET THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SAVE YOURSELF!!!</b><br>
