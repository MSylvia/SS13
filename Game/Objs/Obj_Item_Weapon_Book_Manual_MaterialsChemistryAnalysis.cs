				In today's high tech research fields, leaps and bounds are being made every day. Whether it's great strides forward in our understanding of the physical universe
				or the operation of some fancy new piece of equipment, it seems like all the cool fields are producing new toys to play with leaving doddery old fields such as
				materials analysis and chemistry relegated to the previous few centuries, when we were still learning the makeup and structure of the elements.<br>
				<br>
				Well, when you're out there building the next gryo-whatsitron or isotope mobility thingummy, remember how the field of archaeology experienced a massive new rebirth
				following the excavations at Paranol IV and consider how all of the scientific greats will come crawling back to basic paradigms of natural philosophy when they discover
				a new element that defies classification. I defy you to classify it without reviving this once great field!
