				<h1><a name=""Anomalies"">Modern attitude towards anomalies</a></h1>
				It's only when confronted with things we don't know, that we may push back our knowledge of the world around us. Nowhere is this more obvious than the
				vast and inscrutable mysterious of the cosmos that scholars from such august institutions as the Elysian Institute of the Sciences present
				formulas and hypotheses for every few decades.<br>
				<br>
				Using our vast telescopic array installations and deep space satellite networks, we are able to detect anomalous energy fields and formations in deep space,
				but are limited to those that are large enough to output energy that will stretch across light years worth of distance between stars.<br>
				<br>
				While some sectors (such as the Hydrolian Rift and Keppel's Run) are replete with inexplicable energetic activity and unique phenomena found nowhere else in
				the galaxy, the majority of space is dry, barren and cold - and if past experience has told us anything, it is that there are always more things we are
				unable to explain.<br>
				<br>
				Indeed, a great source of knowledge and technology has always been those who come before us, in the form of the multitudinous ancient alien precursors that
				have left scattered remnants of their great past all over settled (and unexplored) space.<br>
				<br>
				It is from xenoarchaeologists, high energy materials researchers and technology reconstruction authorities that we are able to theorise on the gifts these
				species have left behind, and in some cases even reverse engineer or rebuild the technology in question. My colleague Doctor Raymond Ward of the
				Tyrolian Institute on Titan has made great breakthroughs in a related field through his pioneering development of universally reflective materials capable
				of harvesting and 'bottling' up virtually any energy emissions yet encountered by spacefaring civilisations.<br>
				<br>
				And yet, there are some amongst us who do not see the benefits of those who have come before us - indeed, some among them profess the opinion that there
				is no species that could possibly match humanity in it's achievements and knowledge, or simply that employing non-human technology is dangerous and unethical.
				Folly, say I. If it is their desire to throw onto the wayside the greatest achievements <i>in the history of the galaxy</i>, simply for preferment of the
				greatest achievements <i>in the history of mankind</i>, then they have no business in the establishment of science.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Tri"">Triangulating anomalous energy readings</a></h1>
				Strong energy emissions, when remaining constant from any one fixed location for millenia, can leave an 'imprint' or distinctive energy signature on other
				matter composites that are spatially fixed relative to the source.<br>
				<br>
				By taking samples of such 'fixed' matter, we can apply complex analytics such as the modified Fourier Transform Procedure to reverse engineer the path of the
				energy, and determine the approximate distance and direction that the energy source is, relative to the sample's point in space. Modern portable devices can do
				all this purely by taking readings of local radiation.<br>
				<br>
				A canny researcher can thusly analyse radiationat pre-chosen points strategically scattered around an area, and if there are any anomalous energy
				emissions in range of those points, combined the researcher can triangulate the source.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Synthetic"">Harvesting and utilising anomalous energy signatures</a></h1>
				As mentioned in the forward, my colleague from the Tyrolian Institute on Saturn's moon of Titan, in the Sol System, Doctor Raymond Ward has made great strides
				in the area of harvesting and application of the energy emitted by anomalous phenomena from around the galaxy (although I profess I have not yet seen him
				venture further from his birthplace on Earth than the comfortable distance of the Sol Cis-Oort Satellite Sphere).<br>
				<br>
				By employing a patented semi-phased alloy with unique and fascinating bluespace interaction properties, Ward's contraption is able to 'harvest' energy, store
				it and redirect it later at will (with appropriate electronic mechanisms, of course). Although he professes to see or desire no commercial or material gain
				for the application and use of said energy once it is harvested, there are no doubt myriad ways we can come to benefit from such things beyond mere research,
				such as the reconstruction of torn cartiligenous tissue that a peculiar radiation from an amphibious species on Brachis IV was found to emit.<br>
