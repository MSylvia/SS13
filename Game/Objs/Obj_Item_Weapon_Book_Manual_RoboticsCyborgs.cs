				<h2><a name=""Equipment"">Cyborg Related Equipment</h2>

				<h3>Exosuit Fabricator</h3>
				The Exosuit Fabricator is the most important piece of equipment related to cyborgs. It allows the construction of the core cyborg parts. Without these machines, cyborgs can not be built. It seems that they may also benefit from advanced research techniques.

				<h3>Cyborg Recharging Station</h3>
				This useful piece of equipment will suck power out of the power systems to charge a cyborg's power cell back up to full charge.

				<h3>Robotics Control Console</h3>
				This useful piece of equipment can be used to immobolize or destroy a cyborg. A word of warning: Cyborgs are expensive pieces of equipment, do not destroy them without good reason, or Nanotrasen may see to it that it never happens again.


				<h2><a name=""Modules"">Cyborg Modules</h2>
				When a cyborg is created it picks out of an array of modules to designate its purpose. There are 6 different cyborg modules.

				<h3>Standard Cyborg</h3>
				The standard cyborg module is a multi-purpose cyborg. It is equipped with various modules, allowing it to do basic tasks.<br>

				<h3>Engineering Cyborg</h3>
				The Engineering cyborg module comes equipped with various engineering-related tools to help with engineering-related tasks.<br>

				<h3>Mining Cyborg</h3>
				The Mining Cyborg module comes equipped with the latest in mining equipment. They are efficient at mining due to no need for oxygen, but their power cells limit their time in the mines.

				<h3>Security Cyborg</h3>
				The Security Cyborg module is equipped with effective security measures used to apprehend and arrest criminals without harming them a bit.

				<h3>Janitor Cyborg</h3>
				The Janitor Cyborg module is equipped with various cleaning-facilitating devices.

				<h3>Service Cyborg</h3>
				The service cyborg module comes ready to serve your human needs. It includes various entertainment and refreshment devices. Occasionally some service cyborgs may have been referred to as ""Bros""

				<h2><a name=""Construction"">Cyborg Construction</h2>
				Cyborg construction is a rather easy process, requiring a decent amount of metal and a few other supplies.<br>The required materials to make a cyborg are:
				<ul>
				  <li>Metal</li>
				  <li>Two Flashes</li>
				  <li>One Power Cell (Preferrably rated to 15000w)</li>
				  <li>Some electrical wires</li>
				  <li>One Human Brain</li>
				  <li>One Man-Machine Interface</li>
				</ul>
				Once you have acquired the materials, you can start on construction of your cyborg.<br>To construct a cyborg, follow the steps below:
				<ol>
				  <li>Start the Exosuit Fabricators constructing all of the cyborg parts</li>
				  <li>While the parts are being constructed, take your human brain, and place it inside the Man-Machine Interface</li>
				  <li>Once you have a Robot Head, place your two flashes inside the eye sockets</li>
				  <li>Once you have your Robot Chest, wire the Robot chest, then insert the power cell</li>
				  <li>Attach all of the Robot parts to the Robot frame</li>
				  <li>Insert the Man-Machine Interface (With the Brain inside) Into the Robot Body</li>
				  <li>Congratulations! You have a new cyborg!</li>
				</ol>

				<h2><a name=""Deconstruction"">Cyborg Deconstruction</h2>
				If you want to deconstruct a cyborg, say to remove its MMI without <a href=""#Emergency"">blowing the Cyborg to pieces</a>, they come apart very quickly, <b>and</b> very safely, in a few simple steps.
				<ul>
				  <li>Crowbar</li>
				  <li>Wrench</li>
				  Optional:
				  <li>Screwdriver</li>
				  <li>Wirecutters</li>
				</ul>
				<ol>
				  <li>Begin by unlocking the Cyborg's access panel using your ID</li>
				  <li>Use your crowbar to open the Cyborg's access panel</li>
				  <li>Using your bare hands, remove the power cell from the Cyborg</li>
				  <li>Lockdown the Cyborg to disengage safety protocols</li>
				  <ol>
				    Option 1: Robotics console
				    <li>Use the Robotics console in the RD's office</li>
				    <li>Find the entry for your Cyborg</li>
				    <li>Press the Lockdown button on the Robotics console</li>
				  </ol>
				  <ol>
				    Option 2: Lockdown wire
				    <li>Use your screwdriver to expose the Cyborg's wiring</li>
				    <li>Use your wirecutters to start cutting all of the wires until the lockdown light turns off, cutting all of the wires irregardless of the lockdown light works as well</li>
				  </ol>
				  <li>Use your wrench to unfasten the Cyborg's bolts, the Cyborg will then fall apart onto the floor, the MMI will be there as well</li>
				</ol>

				<h2><a name=""Maintenance"">Cyborg Maintenance</h2>
				Occasionally Cyborgs may require maintenance of a couple types, this could include replacing a power cell with a charged one, or possibly maintaining the cyborg's internal wiring.

				<h3>Replacing a Power Cell</h3>
				Replacing a Power cell is a common type of maintenance for cyborgs. It usually involves replacing the cell with a fully charged one, or upgrading the cell with a larger capacity cell.<br>The steps to replace a cell are follows:
				<ol>
				  <li>Unlock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID on it</li>
				  <li>Open the Cyborg's outer panel using a crowbar</li>
				  <li>Remove the old power cell</li>
				  <li>Insert the new power cell</li>
				  <li>Close the Cyborg's outer panel using a crowbar</li>
				  <li>Lock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID on it, this will prevent non-qualified personnel from attempting to remove the power cell</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Exposing the Internal Wiring</h3>
				Exposing the internal wiring of a cyborg is fairly easy to do, and is mainly used for cyborg repairs.<br>You can easily expose the internal wiring by following the steps below:
				<ol>
				  <li>Follow Steps 1 - 3 of ""Replacing a Cyborg's Power Cell""</li>
				  <li>Open the cyborg's internal wiring panel by using a screwdriver to unsecure the panel</li>
			  </ol>
			  To re-seal the cyborg's internal wiring:
			  <ol>
			    <li>Use a screwdriver to secure the cyborg's internal panel</li>
			    <li>Follow steps 4 - 6 of ""Replacing a Cyborg's Power Cell"" to close up the cyborg</li>
			  </ol>

			  <h2><a name=""Repairs"">Cyborg Repairs</h2>
			  Occasionally a Cyborg may become damaged. This could be in the form of impact damage from a heavy or fast-travelling object, or it could be heat damage from high temperatures, or even lasers or Electromagnetic Pulses (EMPs).

			  <h3>Dents</h3>
			  If a cyborg becomes damaged due to impact from heavy or fast-moving objects, it will become dented. Sure, a dent may not seem like much, but it can compromise the structural integrity of the cyborg, possibly causing a critical failure.
			  Dents in a cyborg's frame are rather easy to repair, all you need is to apply a welding tool to the dented area, and the high-tech cyborg frame will repair the dent under the heat of the welder.

        <h3>Excessive Heat Damage</h3>
        If a cyborg becomes damaged due to excessive heat, it is likely that the internal wires will have been damaged. You must replace those wires to ensure that the cyborg remains functioning properly.<br>To replace the internal wiring follow the steps below:
        <ol>
          <li>Unlock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID</li>
          <li>Open the Cyborg's External Panel using a crowbar</li>
          <li>Remove the Cyborg's Power Cell</li>
          <li>Using a screwdriver, expose the internal wiring or the Cyborg</li>
          <li>Replace the damaged wires inside the cyborg</li>
          <li>Secure the internal wiring cover using a screwdriver</li>
          <li>Insert the Cyborg's Power Cell</li>
          <li>Close the Cyborg's External Panel using a crowbar</li>
          <li>Lock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID</li>
        </ol>
        These repair tasks may seem difficult, but are essential to keep your cyborgs running at peak efficiency.

        <h2><a name=""Emergency"">In Case of Emergency</h2>
        In case of emergency, there are a few steps you can take.

        <h3>""Rogue"" Cyborgs</h3>
        If the cyborgs seem to become ""rogue"", they may have non-standard laws. In this case, use extreme caution.
        To repair the situation, follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Locate the nearest robotics console</li>
          <li>Determine which cyborgs are ""Rogue""</li>
          <li>Press the lockdown button to immobolize the cyborg</li>
          <li>Locate the cyborg</li>
          <li>Expose the cyborg's internal wiring</li>
          <li>Check to make sure the LawSync and AI Sync lights are lit</li>
          <li>If they are not lit, pulse the LawSync wire using a multitool to enable the cyborg's Law Sync</li>
          <li>Proceed to a cyborg upload console. Nanotrasen usually places these in the same location as AI uplaod consoles.</li>
          <li>Use a ""Reset"" upload moduleto reset the cyborg's laws</li>
          <li>Proceed to a Robotics Control console</li>
          <li>Remove the lockdown on the cyborg</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>As a last resort</h3>
        If all else fails in a case of cyborg-related emergency. There may be only one option. Using a Robotics Control console, you may have to remotely detonate the cyborg.
        <h3>WARNING:</h3> Do not detonate a borg without an explicit reason for doing so. Cyborgs are expensive pieces of Nanotrasen equipment, and you may be punished for detonating them without reason.
