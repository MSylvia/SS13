				<h1><a name=""Forward"">Forward: A replacement for cryosleep?</a></h1>
				The development of rudimentary cryofreezing in the 20th and 21st centuries was hailed as a crank science by some, but many early visionaries recognised the
				potential it had to change the way we approach so many fields, such as medicine, therapeutics and space travel. It was breakthroughs in the field in the 22nd and
				later centures that turned the procedure from science fiction to science fact, however. Since then, cryogenics has become a hallmark of modern science, and
				regarded as one of the great achievements of our era. As with all sciences however, they have their time and are superseded by newer technological miracles when
				it is over.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Development"">The breakthrough</a></h1>
				It was in examining the effects of decellerated, blue-space high energy particles when transphased through bluespace that the effects where primarily noticed.
				Due to exigent properties of that dimension, transphasing those particles capable of existing in bluespace with high stability levels has the effect of bringing
				some of those effects into realspace. Examining the Hoffman emissions in particular, it was discovered that they exhibited a-entropic behaviour, and in what is
				now termed the 'Effete Hoffman Principle,' it was found that metastabilising the Hoffman radiation resulted in the effect being applied across other physical
				interactions, in particular forces and reactions.<br>

				<h1><a name=""Application"">Applying this new principle</a></h1>
				When combined with an appropriate energy-effect replicate for cryogenics (slowing down biological activity, thus stabilising the organics), the effect is
				effectively identical to cryogenics, and while it consumes vastly more power and requires extremely complex equipment, it's (for all intents and purposes) superior
				to cryogenics, all that remains is to 'commercialise' the process by enabling cheaper development and mass production.<br>
				The Effete Hoffman Principle can be tweak-combined with other effects however, for different purposes. A division of PMC Research initially developed the application
				in prisons as a literal 'suspension field' where convincts are held immobile in the air, and the use quickly spread to numerous other areas.<br>
				<br>
				By examining the material resonance properties of certain strong waveforms when combined with Hoffman radiation, an effect was produced able to reverse energy
				transferral through matter, and to slow the effects of gravity. When combined with energy repulse technology, the triple effects compound themselves into a much
				stronger field, although all three componenets do slightly different things. High energy researchers assure me of the following key points:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>The energy repulsion factor provides a 'shell' capable of weak suspension.</li>
					<li>The Hoffman emissions nullify energy transferral and other kinetic activity, maintaining stability inside the field.</li>
					<li>The resonant waveform combines the effects of the above two points, and applies it magnified onto it's synched 'resonance' materials.</li>
				</ol>
				As an interesting aside, a carbon waveform was chosen for the field in prison suspension fields, due to it's resonance with organic matter.<br>
