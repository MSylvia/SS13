## Licensing Information

I am not a lawyer or any kind of expert on software licensing, but even I can see that
there's a lot of grey area where SS13's licensing is concerned.
This is how the original code is licensed:

>All code after commit 333c566b88108de218d882840e61928a9b759d8f on 2014/31/12 at 4:38 PM PST (https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station/commit/333c566b88108de218d882840e61928a9b759d8f) is licensed under GNU AGPL v3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

I'm not really sure how this should be interpreted, since the entire codebase has been fed into a transpiler, and it's difficult
to tell which parts of the code are under which license.
You can probably just assume that GPL applies, and the extra stuff in AGPL **probably** applies.

In the interest of avoiding this shitshow in the future, all new code is licensed as follows:
