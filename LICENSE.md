## Licensing Information

I am not a lawyer or any kind of expert on software licensing, but even I can see that
there's a lot of grey area where SS13's licensing is concerned.
This is how the original code is licensed:

>All code after commit 333c566b88108de218d882840e61928a9b759d8f on 2014/31/12 at 4:38 PM PST (https://github.com/tgstation/-tg-station/commit/333c566b88108de218d882840e61928a9b759d8f) is licensed under GNU AGPL v3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

I guess it's best to assume the following:

1. Code is licensed under AGPLv3 -- See LICENSE-AGPLv3.txt for details.
2. Some assets have their own specific licenses, but they live in their own repositories so they're not my problem.

**For the record, I do not approve of this bullshit. If I had my way, all new changes would be licensed under MIT or WTFPL, but it has come to my attention that this might not be okay. I don't really care if this is okay, but I'll deal with the AGPL it if it helps avoids a shitshow.**

Please contact me if you have concerns or suggestions regarding the license.
